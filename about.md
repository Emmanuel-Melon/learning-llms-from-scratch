# Hi, I'm Emmanuel Gatwech üëã

## My Journey Into AI

My background is in [web development](https://emmanuelgatwech.is-a.dev). Like many, I was fascinated by AI but found myself frustrated by the gap between high-level explanations and actual implementation.

The turning point came when [brief personal story, e.g., "I tried to build my first AI-powered feature and realized I didn't understand how any of it actually worked under the hood"].

## Why This Project Exists

After months of late nights, countless tutorials, and more than a few "aha!" moments, I realized something important:

{% ahamoment "The best way to truly understand AI isn't by just using APIs‚Äîit's by building the core concepts yourself." %}

This project is my attempt to document that learning journey, from complete beginner to building real AI applications. No PhD required, just curiosity and a willingness to get your hands dirty with code.

## My Approach

1. **Learn by Building** - Every concept is paired with working code you can run in your browser
2. **No Magic** - We'll break down complex ideas into understandable pieces
3. **Practical First** - Focus on what you can build today with what you learn
4. **Open Source** - This is a living document that grows with community contributions

## What You'll Find Here

- **Chapter 0: AI Fundamentals** - Start here if you're new to AI/ML
- **Chapter 1: RAG Systems** - Build a search engine that understands meaning
- **Upcoming**: Prompt Engineering, Model Evaluation, and more

## The Road Ahead

This is just the beginning. As I continue to learn and grow in my AI journey, I'll be adding more content, more examples, and more practical applications. I hope you'll join me in exploring the fascinating world of AI and machine learning.

Remember: Every expert was once a beginner. The key is to start where you are and keep building.
