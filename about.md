title: About Me - Learning LLMs From Scratch
---

# Hi, I'm Emmanuel Gatwech üëã

Hey, I'm Eman, a software developer from South Sudan who is driven by a passion to change the world and become a polymath
Currently combining engineering work with neuroscience studies at Arizona State University.

## My Journey Into AI: From Web Performance to LLM Architecture

Like many, I was fascinated by the potential of AI but found myself frustrated by the gap between high-level, "black box" explanations and the actual, hands-on implementation. The challenge wasn't _using_ the tools; it was _understanding_ them.

The turning point came when **I started working on systems powered by AI**, such as semantic search engines for legal tech and media processing pipelines for video analysis. This practical need forced me to go beyond surface-level APIs and dig into the first principles.

## Why This Project Exists

After months of late nights, countless tutorials, and more than a few "aha!" moments, I realized something important:

{% ahamoment "The best way to truly understand AI isn't by just using APIs‚Äîit's by building the core concepts yourself. No magic, just architecture." %}

This project is my attempt to document that learning journey, applying my background in **system architecture and debugging** to the world of LLMs. We'll dismantle complex topics and show you how to build a working system from the ground up. No PhD required, just curiosity and a willingness to get your hands dirty with code.

## My Approach

{% stylizedList "

  <li>Learn by Building - Every concept is paired with working code you can run.</li>
  <li>First-Principles Focus - We'll break down complex ideas into the most basic, logical pieces (like breaking down RAG into Retrieval, Augmentation, and Generation).</li>
  <li>Practical First - Focus on what you can build today with what you learn.</li>
  <li>Open Source - This is a living document that grows with community contributions.</li>

## The Road Ahead

This is just the beginning. As I continue to learn and grow in my AI journey, I'll be adding more content, more examples, and more practical applications. I hope you'll join me in exploring the fascinating world of AI and machine learning.

Remember: **Every expert was once a beginner. The key is to start where you are and keep building.**
