The Meta-Pattern for Follow-Ups
Based on your approach, future articles might follow:

1. Start with ignorance
   "I deployed my RAG app to production. It immediately fell over. Here's what I learned about..."
2. Show the actual work
   "I tested 5 chunking strategies on the same dataset. Here are the actual similarity scores..."
3. Explain what clicked
   "I didn't understand why reranking mattered until I saw this specific failure case..."
4. Keep it runnable
   "Here's the minimal code that taught me X. No frameworks, just the concept."
5. Acknowledge limits
   "This works for my use case (1000 documents). I haven't scaled to millions yet."
