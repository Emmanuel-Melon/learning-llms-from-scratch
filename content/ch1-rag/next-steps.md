## The Knowledge Base

In order to get started with RAG, one must first have a **knowledge base**.

I visited the [Uganda Legal Information Institute (ULII)](https://ulii.org/en/), which is a free legal information service provided by the Law Reporting Unit of the Uganda Judiciary and a member of the global Free Access to Law community.

Through ULII, I've gathered the following key legal documents to serve as the knowledge base for my demo:

- The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995, as amended)
- The Landlord and Tenant Act (2022)
